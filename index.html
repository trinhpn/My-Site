		    				<strong>About me</strong>
		    			</h4>
		    			<p>
		    				I'm a senior student at the University of Washington, Tacoma. My major is Computer Science and I'm actively looking for an intership or even better, a full time job. My cumulative GPA is 3.83, but it might drop down more after my Art class ends this quarter, just like how it did with my Music class last quarter ðŸ˜….
		    			</p>
		    			<p>
		    				I'm a tech lover since forever, and that was why I chose to pursue a degree in C.S. after I moved to the U.S. in 2012. I'm hard working, and my employment history with a popular Vietnamese restaurant, a busy Mc Donald's restaurant and a bustling Amazon warehouse will prove that! Beside those labor intensive jobs, I worked as a Math tutor at Highline college when I studied there before transfered. It was one of the greatest experience for me because I got to share my knowledge with people, learn from others, make some friends while improving on my interpersonal skill.
