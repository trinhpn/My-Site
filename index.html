		    				<strong>About me</strong>
		    			</h4>
		    			<p>
		    				I'm a senior student at the University of Washington, Tacoma. My major is Computer Science and I'm actively looking for an intership or even better, a full time job. My cumulative GPA is 3.83, but it might drop down after my Art class this quarter, like it did with my Music class last quarter ðŸ˜….

		    			<p>
		    				You will find other "technical" information about me somewhere belows, but hey, wouldn't you want to know something about me? I'm a tech lover since forever, and that was why I chose to pursue a degree in C.S. after I moved to the U.S. in 2014. I'm hard working, and my employment history with a popular Vietnamese restaurant, a busy Mc Donald's restaurant and a bustling Amazon warehouse will prove that! Beside those labor intensive jobs, I worked as a Math tutor at Highline college when I studied there before transfered. It was one of the greatest experience for me because I got to share my knowledge with people, learn from others, make some friends while improving on my interpersonal skill.
